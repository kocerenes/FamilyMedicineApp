- Following MVVM Architectural Design Pattern

 ## Tech stack
* âœ… MVVM with Clean Architecture
* âœ… [LiveData][23] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
* âœ… [Coroutines][51] - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* âœ… [Navigation Component][24] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation. asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* âœ… [Safe-Args][25] - For passing data between destinations
* âœ… [Dagger-Hilt][93] - A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
* âœ… [ViewModel][17] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* âœ… [Coil][92] - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines
* âœ… [View Binding][11] - a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* âœ… [Data Binding][85] - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
* âœ… [Lifecycle][22] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
* âœ… [Room][12] - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* âœ… [Firebase Auth][91] - You can use Firebase Authentication to let your users authenticate with Firebase using their email addresses and passwords, and to manage your app's password-based accounts.
* âœ… [Firebase Firestore][99] - Use our flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data for client- and server-side development.
